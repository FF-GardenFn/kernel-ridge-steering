# Experiment 5: Dynamic Spectral Monitoring

Provenance: Mirrored from ../../experiments.md (as of 2025-09-18).

### Objective
Track eigenvalue evolution during inference and adapt steering in real-time.

### Hypothesis
Spectral properties change dynamically during generation, requiring adaptive intervention.

### Protocol

Dynamic Monitoring Logic:

If spectral properties evolve during generation, then steering effectiveness varies across timesteps, because attention patterns shift as context accumulates. Eigenvalue gaps can transition from stable to unstable as the model processes different token types, creating windows of opportunity for intervention. Therefore, monitoring spectral evolution and adapting steering strength in real-time maintains consistent control throughout generation.

Adaptive Intervention Process:

1. If eigenvalue gaps decrease below threshold during generation, then emerging instability signals increased controllability, because the model enters a more malleable computational state.
2. If spectral phase transitions occur (sudden gap changes), then these mark behavioral regime shifts, because eigenvalue structure reflects underlying computational modes.
3. If we adapt steering strength based on current spectral state, then maintain consistent influence despite changing controllability, because dynamic adjustment compensates for varying sensitivity.

### Expected Outcomes
- Identification of spectral phase transitions during generation
- Correlation between instability emergence and behavioral shifts
- Improved steering consistency through dynamic adaptation
