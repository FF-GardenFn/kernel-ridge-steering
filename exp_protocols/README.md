# Experimental Protocols Index

This directory organizes each experiment from experiments.md into its own subfolder with a dedicated README.md. The content is mirrored verbatim from experiments.md as of 2025-09-18, with only minimal formatting and provenance notes added.

Experiments:
- [Experiment 1: Causal Validation of Spectral Predictions](exp01_causal_validation/README.md)
- [Experiment 2: Sparse Autoencoder Feature Analysis](exp02_sae_feature_analysis/README.md)
- [Experiment 3: Circuit-Spectral Mapping](exp03_circuit_spectral_mapping/README.md)
- [Experiment 4: Spectral-Enhanced ActAdd](exp04_spectral_enhanced_actadd/README.md)
- [Experiment 5: Dynamic Spectral Monitoring](exp05_dynamic_spectral_monitoring/README.md)
- [Experiment 6: Cross-Architecture Validation](exp06_cross_architecture_validation/README.md)

Provenance:
- Source: ../experiments.md
- Date mirrored: 2025-09-18

Note: The "Meta-Experimental Framework" section remains in experiments.md as shared methodology and is not duplicated per-experiment.
